[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) have the same purpose, they are Javascript package managers.  
npm is installed as the default manager when we install node on our system, while Yarn, initially developed by Facebook, 
is a popular alternative to npm that offers more ore less the same functionality in a different way.   

To install Yarn globally, open your terminal and run:
<pre>
  {`npm i -g yarn`}
</pre>

At this time (March 10, 2022) if you launch the command above, version 1.22.17 of yarn is installed, 
but in reality there is also a version 2 of yarn, with more advanced features and a different api.  

On the yarn official site there is excellent documentation about it:
- [Migrating from npm](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/migrating-from-npm/)
- [MIgration - from yarn 1 to yarn 2](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration)

In some projects I use yarn and in others I use npm, sometimes by my choice, sometimes not ...  
Here is a reminder for the main commands of both tools.
